# Limit-Order-Book

I reconstruct a limit order book from order messages; and compute quantities based on the limit order book. 
Allowing for an understanding of market microstructure and its impact on trading.

To test whether my solution was doing the correct operations or not multiple initial books containing data were taken like the one below:</br>

And the output given by my program was compared to pre-calculated output figures like the one below:

This ensured that my code was doing the expected behaviour and made debugging much easier.
